  "introduction": "Every bread starts with gluten. When flour meets water, two proteins — glutenin and gliadin — begin linking together to form a stretchy, elastic network. This network is what traps gas from fermentation, giving bread its rise and structure.\n\nThere are many ways to develop gluten: kneading (the classic approach), stretch-and-folds (gentler, great for wet doughs), or simply letting time and water do the work (autolyse). In this lesson, you'll get hands-on with gluten and learn to feel when it's properly developed.",
  "objective": "Understand what gluten is and develop it hands-on using kneading or folding",
  "recipeOptions": [

      "whyThisRecipe": "Traditional kneading for 8-10 minutes gives you the most direct, tactile experience of gluten development. You'll feel the dough transform from shaggy to smooth.",

      "whyThisRecipe": "Stretch-and-folds develop gluten gently over time. Great if you want to see how gluten can be built without intense kneading.",

    }
  ],
  "wrapUp": "You've now felt gluten develop in your own hands. Whether you kneaded a firm dough or folded a wet one, you experienced the transformation: shaggy flour and water becoming a smooth, elastic, stretchy dough. This gluten network is the backbone of every bread you'll ever bake. The windowpane test is your reliable check — if the dough stretches thin without tearing, the gluten is ready."
