  "description": "A pillowy, olive-oil-rich flatbread that teaches you what high-hydration dough feels like. Perfect for beginners because it's forgiving and requires no shaping skill.",
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "totalTime": "3.5 hours",
  "activeTime": "25 minutes",
  "servings": "1 sheet pan (about 8 pieces)",
  "conceptsTaught": ["hydration", "fermentation", "enrichment"],

      "instruction": "In a large bowl, combine the bread flour, instant yeast, and fine salt. Add the warm water and 50g olive oil. Mix with a spatula or your hand until no dry flour remains.",
      "tips": [
        "The dough will look shaggy and very wet — this is normal for 80% hydration.",
        "Water should be warm (about 38°C/100°F), not hot. Too hot kills the yeast."

      "id": "focaccia-2",
      "instruction": "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let the dough rest. During this autolyse, the flour absorbs water and gluten begins developing on its own.",

      "timerLabel": "Autolyse rest",
      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "This rest does the work for you — the flour hydrates and gluten strands start forming without any kneading.",

      "id": "focaccia-3",
      "instruction": "Perform a set of stretch-and-folds: with wet hands, grab one side of the dough, stretch it up, and fold it over to the opposite side. Rotate the bowl 90° and repeat. Do all four sides. That's one set. You'll do 4 sets total, resting between each.",

        "Wet your hands before touching the dough to prevent sticking.",

      "tips": [
        "This could take 1–2 hours depending on your kitchen temperature. The timer is a guide — watch the dough, not the clock.",
        "In a warm kitchen (24°C+), it may be ready before the timer. In a cool kitchen, give it more time.",

      "id": "focaccia-5",
      "instruction": "Generously oil your sheet pan with olive oil (about 2 tablespoons). Pour the dough onto the pan. Drizzle more olive oil on top and over your hands. Gently press and stretch the dough toward the edges. If it springs back, let it rest 10 minutes and try again.",
      "tips": [
        "Don't force it — the gluten needs to relax between stretches.",
        "The olive oil is doing double duty: adding flavor and preventing sticking.",
        "It's totally fine if it doesn't fill the pan perfectly on the first try."

      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "The dough should look bubbly, jiggly, and noticeably puffier.",

      "tips": [
        "Be assertive with the dimples — press all the way to the bottom.",
        "The dimples create pockets that pool with olive oil as it bakes.",
