      "instruction": "In a stand mixer bowl (or large bowl), combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Add the eggs and mix on low speed with the dough hook until a shaggy dough forms. Increase to medium speed and knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.",

      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "Brioche dough is very sticky — resist adding extra flour. The stickiness is from the eggs.",
        "The dough should pull cleanly from the sides of the bowl when ready.",

    {
      "id": "brioche-2",
      "instruction": "With the mixer on medium-low, add the cold butter one cube at a time, waiting for each piece to be mostly incorporated before adding the next. This will take about 10 minutes. The dough will look broken and messy midway — this is normal. Keep mixing until smooth.",

      "tips": [
        "Cold butter is key — it incorporates into the gluten network without melting and making the dough greasy.",
        "At 50% butter (baker's percentage), this is a heavily enriched dough. The fat coats gluten strands, making the final bread incredibly tender.",
        "Don't panic when the dough falls apart mid-mixing. It will come back together."

    {
      "id": "brioche-3",
      "instruction": "Once all butter is incorporated, continue mixing on medium speed until the dough is smooth, shiny, and elastic. It should pass the windowpane test — you can stretch a piece thin enough to see light through it without tearing.",

      "tips": [
        "The dough should slap the sides of the bowl cleanly.",
        "It will feel very soft and slightly sticky, but not wet.",

      "tips": [
        "It won't double — enriched doughs rise slower because the fat and sugar weigh them down.",

      "instruction": "Punch down the dough, wrap tightly in plastic, and refrigerate overnight (at least 8 hours, up to 24). Cold fermentation firms the butter, makes the dough easier to shape, and develops deep flavor.",
      "tips": [
        "This overnight rest is not optional — cold dough is essential for shaping brioche.",
        "The slow, cold fermentation produces complex flavors that quick rises can't match.",

      "tips": [
        "Work quickly — the dough is easiest to shape while still cold.",
        "Tuck the dough under itself to create surface tension on top.",
