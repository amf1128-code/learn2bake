      "id": "cinnamon-1",
      "instruction": "In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Add the warm milk, melted butter, and eggs. Mix until a soft dough forms, then knead on medium speed (or by hand) until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.",

      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "This is an enriched dough — the butter, eggs, and sugar make it softer and stickier than a lean dough.",
        "The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl when fully kneaded.",
        "It should feel soft, smooth, and slightly tacky, not sticky."

      "timerLabel": "First rise",
      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "Enriched doughs rise slower than lean doughs because fat and sugar inhibit yeast activity.",
        "This is a key learning moment: compare this rise time to a simple lean dough.",
        "Expect 1–1.5 hours depending on temperature."
      ],

    {
      "id": "cinnamon-3",
      "instruction": "While dough rises, prepare the filling: mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Have the softened butter ready.",
      "tips": [
        "Room temperature butter spreads evenly. Cold butter will tear the dough.",

    {
      "id": "cinnamon-4",
      "instruction": "Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 40x30cm (16x12 inches). Spread the softened butter evenly over the surface, leaving a 1cm border at the far edge. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the butter.",
      "tips": [
        "Even thickness means even rolls. Take your time with the rolling pin.",
        "The butter acts as a glue for the filling and creates layers when rolled.",
        "The bare border at the far edge will help seal the roll."

      "instruction": "Starting from the long edge closest to you, roll the dough up tightly into a log. Pinch the seam closed. Using a sharp knife or dental floss, cut into 12 equal pieces. Place cut-side up in a greased 9x13 inch (23x33cm) baking pan, spacing evenly.",
      "tips": [
        "Dental floss gives the cleanest cuts — slide it under the log, cross the ends, and pull to slice.",
        "A knife works too, but use a sawing motion to avoid squishing the roll.",
        "They should be close but not touching — they'll grow together during proofing."

      "tips": [
        "They should look pillowy and the dough should spring back slowly when poked.",
        "Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) while they proof.",

      "tips": [
        "Glazing hot rolls lets the glaze melt slightly and seep into the crevices.",
