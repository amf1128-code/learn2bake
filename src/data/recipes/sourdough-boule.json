      "timerLabel": "Autolyse",
      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "Autolyse without starter lets enzymes break down starch and begin gluten formation in a pure flour-water environment.",
        "The dough will transform from shaggy to smoother during this rest.",
        "This step gives you a huge head start on gluten development."

      "id": "sourdough-2",
      "instruction": "Add the sourdough starter and salt to the dough. Squeeze and fold the dough in the bowl until the starter and salt are fully incorporated (about 3–4 minutes of working).",
      "tips": [
        "The salt tightens the gluten — you'll feel the dough become more firm and elastic.",
        "Adding starter after autolyse means fermentation starts when you want it to, not before.",
        "The dough may feel rough at first but will smooth out during bulk fermentation."

    },
    {
      "id": "sourdough-3",
      "instruction": "Perform stretch-and-folds every 30 minutes for 6 sets. Each set: with wet hands, grab one side, stretch up, fold over. Rotate and repeat for all four sides. Between sets, keep the bowl covered.",

      "timerLabel": "Stretch & fold",
      "timerType": "interval",
      "intervalCount": 6,
      "tips": [
        "The dough builds more strength with each set — by set 4-5, it should resist stretching and feel springy.",
        "Gentle hands. You're building structure, not degassing.",

    {
      "id": "sourdough-4",
      "instruction": "After the last fold, let the dough continue to bulk ferment undisturbed until it has increased by about 50–75% in volume. The dough should look domed on top, have visible bubbles on the sides, and feel airy when jiggled.",

      "timerLabel": "Remaining bulk fermentation",
      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "This is highly temperature-dependent. At 24°C it might take 2 hours; at 20°C, it could be 3–4 hours.",
        "Use the timer as a rough guide. Watch the dough, not the clock.",
        "Under-fermented dough = dense crumb. Over-fermented = flat loaf. Aim for 50-75% rise."

      "id": "sourdough-5",
      "instruction": "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Pre-shape by gently folding the edges toward the center, then flip seam-side down. Using a bench scraper or your hands, drag the dough toward you to create surface tension. Let it rest.",

      "timerLabel": "Bench rest",
      "timerType": "countdown",
      "tips": [
        "Surface tension is everything — it's what lets the dough hold its shape in the oven.",
        "The dough should look like a taut, smooth dome after pre-shaping.",

      "id": "sourdough-6",
      "instruction": "Final shape: flip the dough over (seam up), fold the top down to center, fold the bottom up to overlap, fold the sides in, then roll tightly toward you to create a taut ball. Place seam-side up in a well-floured banneton or a towel-lined bowl dusted with rice flour.",
      "tips": [
        "Each fold adds another layer of tension. Tighter shaping = better oven spring.",
        "The seam goes up in the banneton because you'll flip it out for baking.",

      "id": "sourdough-7",
      "instruction": "Cover the banneton tightly and refrigerate overnight (12–16 hours). This cold retard slows fermentation, develops flavor, and firms the dough for easier scoring.",
      "tips": [
        "Cold retarding is what gives sourdough its complex, tangy flavor.",
        "The cold dough will also score much more cleanly than warm dough.",

      "tips": [
        "Scoring controls where the bread expands in the oven — without it, the bread tears randomly.",
        "One long slash works beautifully for a boule. You can get creative later.",
        "Cold dough scores cleanly. Don't let it warm up before scoring.",
