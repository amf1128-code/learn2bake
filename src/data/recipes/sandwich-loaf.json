  "description": "A classic white sandwich bread that teaches fundamental dough handling. At 65% hydration, this dough is firm enough to knead and shape — the opposite end of the spectrum from focaccia.",

      "tips": [
        "At 65% hydration, this dough should feel noticeably firmer than a focaccia dough.",

      "instruction": "Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and knead for 8–10 minutes. After 5 minutes, incorporate the softened butter by flattening the dough, spreading the butter on, then folding and kneading until fully absorbed. The dough should become smooth, elastic, and pass the windowpane test.",

        "The 'letter fold then roll' method creates even tension throughout the loaf.",
